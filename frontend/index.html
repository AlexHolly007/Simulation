        <span class="msg">Welcome to the Simulation! This is a choose your own adventure game, but you can make up<br>
            any situation you want! To try it out, start by creating a scenario in the User Input box. Use <br>
            third person for the best results. Then hit the “Generate” to illustrate your response. This will<br>
            clear your previous entry and allow you to continue the story off of the computer generated response. <br><br>

            Some examples:<br>  
            ‘A small creature is walking through a moist dark forest.’<br>  
            ‘A person is running along the top of the skyscrapers in a shiny city at sunset.’<br>
            ‘The dragon roams through the bright red caves.’<br><br>

            After receiving a response, you will be able to enter another response in the <br>
            User Prompt area once again to continue the story how you like.<br><br>

            This button in the bottom right is used to 'reset'------------------------------------------------ ><br>
            this simulation, clearing all previous entrys and memory and restarts a blank adventure.

            After the generative AI has responded with a picture and text illustrating <br>
            your creative simulation, you can respond in this text box to continue the <br>
            simulation, for example explain a next step you would like to see happen. This<br>
